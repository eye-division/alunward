A selection of abstract oil and acrylic paintings produced from the studio in Christ Church, Oxford, from 1994 to 2003.

These developed finally into the <a href="/goldschmidt/">Goldschmidt series</a> of asteroid paintings, and the <a href="/kamarupa/">Kamarupa series</a> of cloud paintings, since when my work has branched into video and installation work.
