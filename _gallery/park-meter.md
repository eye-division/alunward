An old fashioned parking meter, installed next to a large Douglas Fir (Pseudotsuga Menziesii) which had been parked for far too long in Nuneham Courtenay Arboretum.

In July 2009 I was part of an international project at The University of Oxford Harcourt Arboretum, Nuneham Courtenay, working with eleven other artists, some from France, Germany and Romania.

During this period I also produced <em><a href="/megasporangiate/">Megasporangiate Strobili</a></em>.
