I started to run regularly in 2004, swiftly fell in love with it, and since then have spent more hours on the trail then I have in the studio. 'Run' represents a first attempt to unite these two consuming pursuits. My aim in creating the piece was to try to give a sense of running as a rhythmical and visual experience which isn't necessarily about reaching an end point. Nonetheless, I wanted to link this directly to particular places and times of day, and to encourage viewers to encounter even familiar places afresh.

A Short Run is a five minute video, a version of the full RUN which lasts 30 minutes. The film was first shown at the Metron exhibition with Clare Carswell in Oxford in 2007.
