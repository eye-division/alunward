  This series of shadow drawings was prompted by the search for narrative in previous abstract works. Soon afterwards I came across **Adalbert von Chamisso's** nineteenth century tale of Peter Schlemihl, *The Man who Sold His Shadow*.
  The drawings soon came to resemble frames from a film, and the obvious next step was taken with *Shadow Me*, a seven minute long animated movie with music by composer Pia Silvi.
