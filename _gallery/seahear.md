<strong>Sea Hear</strong> originated with recordings of people's memories of the sea or seaside. These stories are then relayed and remixed through miniature speakers embedded in a small beach of pebbles. The recordings mingle and merge into a sea of sound where the voices are barely distinguishable, and only on holding and lifting a pebble to the ear can individual stories be heard.

<strong>Sea Hear</strong> was part of **Seeing Sound from Inside Out** at Fringe Arts Bath in May 2015. Visitors to the exhibition were invited to record their memories and experiences of the sea.
