The <strong>Kamarupa</strong> series of paintings developed from abstract paintings, in which sections were removed from large expressive canvases and re-hung, framed inside white panels.

I began to experiment with the use of clouds, forms which are fleeting and often boundary-less. Alongside this practical development was a continuing fascination with the use of names to classify and make sense of the world. A previous work involved the discovery and naming of asteroids by a nineteenth century painter, Hermann Goldschmidt.  In this instance I came across the history of Luke Howard and his definitions of clouds - cumulus, cirrus, etc. It seems that by concentrating on the small essential elements of nature, he was hoping to gain a sense of the bigger picture.
