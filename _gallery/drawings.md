This series of shadow drawings was prompted by the search for narrative in previous abstract works. Soon afterwards I came across <strong>Adalbert von Chamisso's</strong>, the author of <em>Peter Schlemihls wundersame Geschichte</em>, 1814, or <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/5339" title="Read the text on Project Gutenberg">The Man Who Sold His Shadow</a>, a popular children's tale even today. A year later Chamisso travelled as naturalist on the Rurik Expedition to discover a north-east passage in the Bering Straits. His tale of the shadow can be read as a reflection of his own feelings of dislocation and homelessness as a Frenchman by birth living on German soil. He was a poet of the Romantic movement who spent his life as a naturalist in the pursuit of truth in science.
