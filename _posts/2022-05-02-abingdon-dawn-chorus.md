Recorded in the Ock Valley Walk woodland at dawn on Bank Holiday Monday. Equipment was a Sound Devices MixPre 3 mixer and two DPA 4060 stereo mics attached to nettles. Dry, wind-less, so although in a fairly busy town, this was a quiet time. You can distinctly hear Muntjac deer cracking twigs underfoot.
